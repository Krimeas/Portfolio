      <p>My name is Cody Berry.  I am currently attending a coding Bootcamp at UT Austin and I will be graduating this December.  I have 15 years of experience in a CNC manufacturing startup where Iâ€™ve worn many different hats ranging from Purchasing and Inventory Control Manager, to Salesman, Office Manager, and even Shop Floor Supervisor.  While not all of those skills transfered over to my new career path; the ability to talk with and manage others through projects will no doubt help me moving forwards.
